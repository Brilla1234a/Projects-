# Credit Risk Analysis

## Summary
The Credit Risk Project aims to assist a leading bank in predicting bad customers during the loan application process. The project focuses on building PD Models (Probability of Default) to determine the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their loan. By leveraging data and predictive modeling techniques, the project aims to provide insights that can help the bank make informed decisions and mitigate potential risks.

## Project Details
The project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about customers, including their age, education level, employment details, address, income, debt-to-income ratio, credit-to-debt ratio, and other debts. The target variable is whether the customer has defaulted in the past.

The project begins with exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between the variables. Data visualization techniques, such as bar plots, pie charts, and box plots, are employed to gain insights into the data and identify patterns or trends.

Next, the project applies machine learning algorithms, specifically the Random Forest classifier, to develop a predictive model for identifying potential defaulters. The dataset is divided into existing customers (for model training and evaluation) and new customers (for future predictions). The Random Forest algorithm is chosen due to its ability to handle class imbalance and its effectiveness in classification tasks.

The project evaluates the performance of the Random Forest model using various metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's classification results.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the Random Forest model demonstrates promising results in predicting customer defaults. The project provides valuable insights for the bank in identifying high-risk customers and making informed decisions during the loan approval process.
